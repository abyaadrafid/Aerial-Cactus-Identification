# [Aerial Cactus Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification)

This was one my of very first competitions. While doing [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/), this competition provided a good source of practise. It was a binary classification probelm. The goal for this competition was to determine whether the given satellite image contained a columnur cactus. 

I used this dataset for two purposes :

1. To implement and test [ArcFace](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07698.pdf) using pytorch.
2. To get placed into a high LeaderBoard position in the competition using FastAI.

## Approach

### EDA 
According to the dataset details, the images were taken from the air. The images are low-res, some of them rotated to arbitrary angles and some zoomed. From visual inspection, the cacti are somewhat easy to spot because of their unique texture and stick-like shape. The class imbalance is not severe, can be handled by data augmentation.
### Data split and Transforms
#### Split : 
As the class imbalance was not servere, the data could be split into train/valid set at random.
#### Transforms : 
Following Transforms were applied with 75% probability to augment the date, then the images were resized to 128*128. Test time augmentation was not applied.  

1. Horizontal Flip
2. Vertical Flip
3. Left and Right rotation upto 10Â°
4. Upto 110% zoom
### Models
I used DenseNet169 and Resnet101 for Leaderboard and ArcFace for research purposes.

### ArcFace
ArcFace was applied on the Resnet101 backbone. Implemented from scratch in pytorch. With embedding dimension = 2 and scale_factor (s) = 64, accuracy follows :

#### DenseNet169
Densenet169 needs more time to converge because of its enormous size and paramters.

#### Resnet101
Resnet101 needed less time to converge.
